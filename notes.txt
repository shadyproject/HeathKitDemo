All values are immutable in health kit, can only be created with the constructors

HKUnit
  1) Handles metric or imperial and conversions
  2) can be simple (mg) or complex (mg/dL)
  3) create with constructors and composition, or with format strings
  3) units specify what they can and cant be converted to, will throw an exception if no conversion
      - there is a method to check if units are convertible
  4) Cannot create your own units

HKQuantity
  1) Basically just a CGFloat
  2) can specify the units with which it will work, and throw an exception if not compatible

HKObjectType
  1) Defines which type of information health kit can record
      - cannot create your own, only what HealthKit supplies
  2) Two different types
      - HKCharacteristicType
          * a phsyical characteristic that doesn't change.
            - Blood Type, Biological Sex, Birth Date
          * Apparently, we can't set these, they can only be set via the HealthApp
      - HKSampleType
          * the only kind we actually use, represents a sample of data
          * HKQuantityType
            - The kind you'll mostly use, has a double value and an associated type
      - HKCategoryType
          * right now, there is only one kind: HKSleepAnalysis
          * represents a value in an enum, when creating the value you MUST use a value from the enum

HKObject
  1) All objects have a UUID
  2) All objects have a source
      - each app is a source
      - specific pieces of hardware are also sources
  3) All objects have metadata in the form of dictionaries
      - this is the only real "extensibility" available in health kit
  4) All data is a subclass of this
      - HKQuantitySample
          * HKCategoryType
          * HKQuantity
      - HKCategorySample
          * HKCategoryType
          * NSIntegr (represnts an enum)
  5) HKSample is direct subclass of HKObject
      - Adds start date and end date

How to save data into health kit
  1) Create an HKUnit
  2) Create an HKQuantity
  3) Create an HKQuantityType (or an HKCategoryType, but never an HKCharacteristicType since those dont' exist)
  4) Create an HKQuantitySample (or an HKCategorySample but never a blah blah blah see above)

How to get data out of health kit
  1)Queries


Using Health Kit
  1) Entitlements
  2) Request permission to read and share
      This is done *per object type* and you have to request for everything you want
      You only know if you have sharing authorization.
      You dont' know if you have been approved or denied reading access, because security


Errata
  1) Three new custom formatters for working with HealthKit data
